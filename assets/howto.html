<p><center><h2>How to Play</h2></center></p>

<p><b>Summary:</b><br>
The object of the game is to use a ball to clear all the colored bricks from the screen. Guide your ship by placing your finger on the location
you want to move the ship. You start out with one (1) ball. If all your balls fall to the bottom of the screen, you lose a life
and have to start the level over again. If you lose all your lives (you start out with three (3)), the game ends and you are sent
back to the first level. The game comes with 100 levels built in, and allows for user created custom levels, both locally and
online. Your progress is saved automatically, and unless you explicitly reset the game, you will continue from where you
left off the next time you play.</p>

<p><b>Brick Types:</b><br>
There are four (4) brick types. Red, yellow, green, and steel. <font color="red">Red</font> bricks only take one hit to destroy. If the brick contains a power-up, it will
drop from the location of the brick after it's been destroyed. <font color="yellow">Yellow</font> bricks take two hits to
destroy. That is, when you hit a yellow brick, it becomes a red brick. Likewise, <font color="#00FF00">green</font> bricks
take three (3) hits to destroy, turning yellow, then red, then disappearing. <font color="#C0C0C0">Steel</font> bricks cannot
be destroyed. They serve as obstacles to the other bricks. You will often have to angle hits accordingly in order to get the
ball to bounce off a steel brick at the correct angle to clear away all the other bricks.</p>

<p><b>Your Ship:</b><br>
Your ship, located toward the bottom of the screen, is a lean, mean, brick-killing machine! You control your ship by touching
the area of the screen you want it to go to. Move your ship in front of a ball in order to reflect it back toward the bricks.
The angle of reflection will vary depending on which part of the ship the ball hits. If it hits more toward the center, it will
reflect straighter upwards. If it hits one of the sides, it will reflect at a broader angle. You can only move your ship
horizontally.</p>

<p><b>Power-Ups:</b><br>
Aww yeah. <i>The Brickening</i> features eight (8) different power-ups that can be obtained for your brick destroying pleasure.
They are as follows:</p>

<p><img src="brick_1up.PNG" align=left><b>Extra Life:</b> The classic video game staple. Obtaining this power-up gives you
a new lease on life, giving you another chance to continue your epic battle against the bricks until you clutch victory in your squishy
fingers.</p>

<p><img src="brick_add3.PNG" align=left><b>Extra Balls:</b> For when one just isn't enough. This power-up gives you three (3)
extra balls to attack the bricks with. The more balls you can manage to juggle at a time, the faster you'll clear a level, and
the more bonus points you'll get.</p>

<p><img src="brick_barricade.PNG" align=left><b>Barricade:</b> This power-up places a row of red bricks below your ship. This temporarily prevents
the balls from falling off the screen. Bonus points if you can keep the barricade bricks from being knocked away.</p>

<p><img src="brick_double.PNG" align=left><b>Double Size Ship:</b> Bigger is better. Getting this power-up will cause your
ship to grow twice its normal size. This makes it easier to catch those ever-so-tricky fast balls.</p>

<p><img src="brick_half.PNG" align=left><b>Half Size Ship:</b> This item causes your ship to shrink to half its normal
size. At first this might be viewed as a "power-down", however, you are given double points
for any blocks you knock out while this item is equipped. The challenge is greater, but so is the reward.</p>

<p><img src="brick_laser.PNG" align=left><b>Laser:</b> Ah, the sharks best friend. The laser power-up allows you to fire
a laser beam at the bricks. Very helpful for clearing out stages quicker and easier, as well as getting to those hard-to-reach bricks.
Bear in mind, this item doesn't shoot through steel, so that limits its usefulness in some cases. Fire the laser by
holding your finger down on the screen.</p>

<p><img src="brick_sticky.PNG" align=left><b>Sticky Ship:</b> When this power-up is equipped, the ball will stick to your
ship until you let your finger off the screen. This way, you can have more control over where the ball goes and what it
bounces off of.</p>

<p><img src="brick_ghost.PNG" align=left><b>Ghost Ship:</b> This power-up leaves a translucent ghost trail behind your ship. The ghost
ship can reflect balls off of it just like your regular ship, giving you the advantage of extra range.</p>

<p><b>Scoring:</b> Your score and current level are recorded at the top-left corner of the screen. Your score is increased
as you clear bricks from the screen, and obtain power-ups such as +3, Barricade, and Half Ship Size. Your score is decreased
as you lose balls and lose lives. When your game ends (either with a Game Over after losing all your lives, or by completing
all 100 levels), if your score breaks the top 20 on the local leaderboard, you will be prompted to enter a high score. Your
name can be any combination of alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) characters (as long as it doesn't contain an obscene word!).
Non-alphanumeric characters will be silently filtered from your name. You also have the option of uploading your score
online, and viewing other scores posted online. Scores from custom maps cannot be recorded as high scores.

<p><b>Custom Maps:</b> From the gameplay screen, you can browse through and play custom maps online, or create and upload your own
using the in-game level editor. When you load a custom map, your current game progress will be lost, and you will not be
able to post a high score obtained as the result of a custom map game.</p>
