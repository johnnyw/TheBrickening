<p><b>Basic Controls:</b><br>In Level Editor mode, you are given an 8x21 grid to place bricks. Below the grid is
a selector with which you can change the current tool. You can change the brick color or current power-up. When you
touch a slot in the edit grid, the current brick or power-up will be placed in that space. To erase a particular brick or power-up,
equip it in the selector and touch the brick or power-up you want to remove. You must place at least one non-steel brick
in the level in order for it to be playable, and you cannot place power-ups inside steel bricks.

<p><b>Saving/Playing:</b><br>Press the MENU button to save a level to your local device. You will be prompted to enter a name, which
can consist only of alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) characters (non-alphanumeric characters will be silently filtered out). If there's already a level stored on your device with that name,
or the name is obscene, you will be prompted to enter another name. You can play the level by pressing the
BACK button from the editor, pressing the MENU button in the game, selecting "Browse Custom Levels", and touching the level
as displayed in the Custom Level Browser.</p>

<p><b>Uploading:</b><br>Once you are happy with your creation, <i>The Brickening</i> allows you to share it with other players
online. To upload a level, press the MENU button in the editor, select "Upload", and enter a name for your level. The name
restrictions are the same as locally stored levels. The level cannot have the same name as another level stored on the upload server. Whatever
level data is currently loaded in the editor is what will be uploaded, so you don't even need to save it locally if you don't
want to (though that's probably a good idea). To play custom levels from online, press BACK from the editor to get in the game,
press the MENU button, then select "Browse Custom Levels". Press the MENU button in the Custom Level Browser and select "Browse Online Levels".</p>

<p><b>Deleting:</b><br>To delete a level, press the MENU button in the editor, select "Delete", then touch the local custom level
you want to delete. You will be prompted for confirmation before you delete. Once you delete a level, you can't get it back, and once
you upload a level to the server, you can't take it back.</p>

<p><b>Random Tips:</b><br>It is recommended that you use the steel brick sparingly as it can significantly increase
the difficulty of clearing a given level. Placing bricks very close to the front of the ship is not recommended as the player
will not have very much time to react to the ball bouncing off of it. Power-ups like +3 allow you to clear the level much more
quickly, so use that sparingly if you're concerned about your level being cleared too quickly.

<p>Once a custom level is cleared, the player will be taken back to the first level of the game.</p>
